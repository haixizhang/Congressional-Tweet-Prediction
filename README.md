# Congressional-Tweet-Prediction
Description
In this competition, you will be working with a Congressional Twitter Dataset. The dataset is a collection of tweets posted by Congressional politicians on Twitter [excluding tweets with no hashtags.].

The training dataset includes tweets posted, and a few features associated with tweets including the partisanship information of the politician who posted the tweet. The test dataset has the same features excluding the partisanship id [for convenience, the party classification has been set to 'D' in the test dataset].

Your task will be to correctly predict the partisanship of the politician who posted the tweet(s) by analyzing tweet-specific information.

Descriptive information about the features included in the dataset:

Id : id number associated with the tweet
favorite _ count : number of times the tweet was favorited
full _ text : full text of the tweet
hashtags : list of hashtags included in the tweet
retweet _ count : number of times the tweet has been retweeted
year : year of the tweet
party : partisanship of the owner of the tweet [D = 'Democrat', R = 'Republican']
